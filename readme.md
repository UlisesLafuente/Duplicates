# Exercise 1 — Duplicates
In this exercise you will use two of the most common Java collections: ArrayListand HashSet. You will practice how to add and modify elements, and you will see how these collections behave in the presence of duplicates.

## 📌 Enusation of the exercise (if applicable)

Create a class called Month with an attribute name, to store the name of the month. Add 11 objects Month to a ArrayList, leaving out "August". Insert this month in the corresponding position and check that the order of the months is correct.

Then convert the ArrayListin one HashSetand verifies that duplicates are not allowed.

Finally, he runs through the collection with a loop forand with a Iterator.
