# Exercise 1 — Duplicates

In this exercise you will use two of the most common Java collections: ArrayList and HashSet. You will practice how to add and modify elements, and you will see how these collections behave in the presence of duplicates.

Enunciated

Create a class called Month with an atribute name, to store the name of the month. Add 11 objects Month to a ArrayList, leaving out "August". Insert this month in the corresponding position and check that the order of the months is correct.

Then convert the ArrayList in one HashSet and verifies that duplicates are not allowed.

Finally, runs that through the collection with a loop for and with a Iterator.
